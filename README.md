**🎮 Project Overview**

ISL Arena is a fully interactive 3D virtual campus game, built to showcase an immersive digital recreation of the ISL Engineering College.
The project leverages Unreal Engine’s capabilities to deliver:

✨ Realistic 3D environment modeled after the college campus

🎥 3D display rendering for enhanced visual experience

🧭 Head-tracking support for immersive navigation

✋ Gesture-based controls enabling natural interaction

🎮 Engaging gameplay designed to simulate a real-time virtual walk-through

This project demonstrates my early experience in game development, 3D modeling, and immersive UI design.

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

Unreal Engine 3

Unreal Engine tool packages:

3D rendering system

Head-tracking integration

Gesture recognition modules

**📚 Learning Outcomes**

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

Building interactive environments in Unreal Engine

Working with 3D assets and scene composition

Designing immersive user experiences (UX)

Understanding gesture-based interaction concepts

Implementing camera and navigation mechanics

**💡 Future Scope**

If revisited, the project could be enhanced by:

Rebuilding using Unreal Engine 5 for higher realism

Adding VR support

Enhancing gameplay mechanics and objectives

Creating a full campus tour application
